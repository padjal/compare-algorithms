# compare-algorithms
This project compares the speed of different algorithms. It does so by running
many tests and recording the time spent. Using this information, I have presented
the information in graphs, which help to understand the information more easily.

## About me

at HSE university, Moscow, where I am currently a bachelor in second year.
