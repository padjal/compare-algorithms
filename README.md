# compare-algorithms ⏲️
## ➡️ Intro
This project compares the speed of different algorithms. It does so by running many tests and recording the time spent. Using this information, I have presented the information in graphs, which help to understand the information more easily.

## 📖 Contents
This repository contains more than just the code used for this project. There are also reports, tests, and other data divided as such:
 - Source code
    - [Algorithm implementations](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/tree/main/CompareAlgorithms/algorithms)
    - [Utilities](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/tree/main/CompareAlgorithms/utils)
    - [Main runner](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/blob/main/CompareAlgorithms/main.cpp)
    - [Tests](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/tree/main/CompareAlgorithms/Google_tests)
  - Results - this is just a placeholder folder for the results of the program and tests
    - [Program results](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/tree/main/CompareAlgorithms/results)
    - [Test results](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/tree/main/CompareAlgorithms/results/tests)
  - [Data](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/tree/main/data) - a folder containing results used for the diagrams
  - [Diagrams](https://github.com/padjal/compare-algorithms/tree/main/diagrams) - folder containing the resulting diagrams

## 💎 Results
The results of this experiment are divided in two parts:
 - The data files from each different collection of items 
 - The resulting tables and charts [charts](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PMlP1ESOIdAixUlooa60m8eL2VymPFyXyPgPI7gwLfo/edit?usp=sharing)
